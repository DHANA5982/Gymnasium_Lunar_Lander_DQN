# Lunar Lander Agent using Deep Q-Network

- Developed a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent from scratch to solve the LunarLander-v3 environment using PyTorch and Gymnasium, demonstrating a strong grasp of reinforcement learning concepts.
- Designed and implemented a custom neural network architecture to accurately approximate Q-values, enabling the agent to make optimal decisions in a complex, continuous state space.
- Built an efficient experience replay memory system to store and sample past experiences, significantly improving training stability and sample efficiency.
- Engineered a robust DQN agent class, integrating neural network optimization, soft target network updates, and epsilon-greedy exploration for effective learning.
- Tuned hyperparameters and conducted extensive training over thousands of episodes, achieving high average scores and solving the environment ahead of the benchmark.
- Visualized the agent’s learning progress and final performance by generating and displaying gameplay videos, providing clear evidence of the model’s effectiveness.
